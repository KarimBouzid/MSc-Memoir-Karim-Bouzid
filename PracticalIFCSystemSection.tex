The practical impedance-sensing system will be described in this chapter, based on the theoretical concepts explained previously in \autoref{chap:Electronics} and \autoref{chap:ImpedimetricSensors}. Practical examples will also be considered to get a sense of the methodology and mathematics. Finally, the PCB will be displayed, as well as the protocol to adequately sample impedance values using the device.
