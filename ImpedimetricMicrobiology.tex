When applied to microbiology, impedimetric techniques can be used for the measurement of whole cells, cells suspended in a solution or cells adhered to a substrate. The models for these techniques vary but they all share the same basic theory \cite{Xu2016}. One or more of the parameters found in the cell-electrolyte models is linked to its impedance. This parameter can thus be monitored from the impedance response and a flag is raised when a significant change is observed from the baseline value. This makes for a straightforward, sensitive, and quantitative detection method that is low cost, free of specialized chemicals, non-invasive, and that offers a “load and forget” experience for the user \cite{Grossi2017,Kargupta2018}.
