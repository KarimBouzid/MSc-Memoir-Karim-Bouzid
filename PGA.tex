Programmable Gain Arrays (PGA) are an electronic scheme to modify on the fly the gain of a system. PGA allow an amplifier to choose from multiple values of gain resistor $R_f$.  This can be achieved with simple relays or multiplexers that can switch when toggled between different resistors \cite{Chabowski2015,horowitz1989art}. The gains are generally controllable by the MCU (see \autoref{sec:MCU}) and the PGA is generally placed in the feeback loop of an amplifier. An exemple of a PGA is provided in \autoref{fig:PGA}.
