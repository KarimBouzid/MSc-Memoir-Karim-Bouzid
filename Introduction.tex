One of the key goals of this thesis is to conceive a novel biosensor that could successfully detect and characterize microorganisms, microparticles, and compounds directly in their own natural habitat. Indeed, no such devices is universally recognized yet, and many environmental pathogens of global significance are still invisible to the scientific community per lack of adequate sensors to discover them \cite{Hutchins2019}. To that end, a portable and autonomous biosensors that could continuously monitor environmental and target-specific parameters must be designed to monitor environmental changes and their effects on microorganisms. Such real-time monitoring sensor could provide important insights into the dynamical biochemical processes that take place in biofluids and soil samples, monitor the quantity of microorganisms in an environment, and potentially identify new significant microorganisms in previously unattainable zones \cite{Kim2019,Hutchins2019}. \par
