The Matlab and Python codes can be found in my \underline{\href{https://github.com/KarimBouzid/IFC_impedance_sensor}{Github repository}}. The Python code is mostly used for data acquisition and machine learning, while the Matlab code is used for post-processing. The datasets are included in the \underline{\href{https://github.com/KarimBouzid/IFC_impedance_sensor}{Github repository}}.
