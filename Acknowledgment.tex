I would like to thank my two incredible professors for their support and guidance throughout my MSc, Professor Benoit Gosselin and Professor Sandro Carrara. I would also like to thanks the numerous persons that helped me these last two years. Martin Gagnon of the technical service provided me with countless advices and technical supports. Gabriel Gagnon-Turcotte and Partha Sarati Das acted as true mentors during my research. My fellow students of the Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory Mohamad Feshki, Vahid Khojasteh, Mohammad Makhdoumi Akram, Saeed Ghaneei-Aarani, Michelle Janusz, FÃ©lix Chamberland, Magali Ozon, Mousa Karimi, Simon Tam, Nazilah Hosseini, and  Quentin Mascreet. Fellow students from the EPFL Gian Luca Barbruni and Leonardo Iannucci. And finally my brother Sami Bouzid who inspired me to pursue research in the field of electronics.
